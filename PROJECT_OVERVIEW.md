# JobIntel-DevOps-Driven Job Tracker Platform

## WHAT IT IS

**JobIntel** is a fully cloud-native, infrastructure-as-code-powered system that tracks your job applications like a production-grade service.**

This isn’t a spreadsheet. This is a **DevOps pipeline built to manage your career that anyone can use**, powered by the same technologies used in high-scale engineering teams. From infrastructure to automation to deployment, every layer is mapped to real-world certifications — and built to prove I’m not just “studying DevOps,” I’m living it.

## WHAT IT DOES

    • Automates tracking of job applications
    • Logs recruiter names, interviews, feedback, and status via **CLI or Slack bot** (undecided)
    • Stores application data in **AWS (S3, DynamoDB, Lambda)** securely
    • Uses **Terraform** to provision and manage all infrastructure
    • Automatically deploys updates via **GitHub Actions CI/CD**
    • Exposes progress and metrics via a **web dashboard or report** (undecided)
    • Uses **OpenAI/NLP** to analyze feedback, detect patterns, and give career insight

## WHAT IT PROVES

    • I know how to write and deploy **modular, secure infrastructure**
    • I can manage **backend automation, CI/CD, and cloud-native workflows**
    • I map **certification concepts** into real projects that solve real problems
    • I document and version my infrastructure with **GitHub best practices**
    • I treat my career like a product — with automation, metrics, and iteration

## PROJECT PHASES + PROGRESS

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

    - S3 bucket for data and resume storage
    - Randomized naming using `random_id`
    - Bucket security via `ownership_controls` and `public_access_block`
    - Documented Terraform with in-line comments
    - Successfully deployed via CLI (WSL)
    - Committed to GitHub with clean history

### Phase 2: GitHub Polish + CI/CD

    - Add `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` to modularize setup
    - Create `.github/workflows/terraform.yml` to automate:
        - `terraform fmt -check`
        - `terraform validate`
        - `terraform plan`
    - Update `README.md` with:
        - Project intro
        - Architecture diagram
        - Cert mapping + tech stack
        - Example outputs
        - Screenshot of `terraform plan`
        - Commit badge

### Phase 3: Backend API + Slack Bot

    - Build Python backend (FastAPI or Flask)
    - Add CLI commands or Slack bot endpoints (`/logjob`, `/pitch`, `/status`)
    - Store and retrieve from **DynamoDB**
    - Summarize feedback/status with Slack or terminal output
    - Containerize the backend with **Docker**

### Phase 4: Deployment + Monitoring

    - Deploy backend using **Lambda, EC2, or Kubernetes** (CKA alignment)
    - Add **CloudWatch logs** and **IAM roles**
    - Secure the pipeline with **least privilege IAM policies**
    - Configure **GitHub Actions** to auto-deploy new versions
    - Implement **Terraform remote state sharing** across JobIntel repos
    - Use terraform_remote_state in jobintel-api and jobintell-cicd to pull:
        • bucket_name
        • bucket_arn
        • region
        • DynamoDB table name, Lambda ARNs, etc.

### Phase 5: Intelligence Layer

    - Use **OpenAI API** to:
    - Tag feedback trends (e.g., “underqualified,” “cloud gaps,” etc.)
    - Analyze rejection messages using NLP
    - Generate **weekly career stats reports**:
    - Total applications, rejection reasons, pipeline strength
    - Delivered via Slack, email, or dashboard
    - Use this data to optimize career strategy like an actual DevOps product lifecycle

## CERTIFICATION MAPPING

| Layer                | Tech Used                        | Certs It Supports                          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Infra as Code        | Terraform, AWS                   | Terraform Associate, AWS SA Pro           |
| Secure Auth          | IAM, AWS CLI credentials         | AWS SA Pro                                |
| Containerization     | Docker, Kubernetes)   | Docker DCA, CKA                           |
| CI/CD Pipelines      | GitHub Actions                   | DevOps Core, GitHub CI/CD best practices  |
| Backend API          | Python (FastAPI/Flask), Boto3    | Python Cert                     |
| Monitoring & Logging | CloudWatch, IAM roles            | AWS SA Pro, Cloud Security (future)       |
| Intelligence Layer   | OpenAI API, NLP                  | ML/NLP Curiosity             |

## WHY IT STANDS OUT

Most DevOps portfolios are just clones of tutorials.
**This project is personal, cert-aligned, automated, and evolving.**

It proves I can:

    • Design infrastructure from scratch
    • Secure, deploy, and monitor production-ready systems
    • Add intelligence and career automation at every stage
    • Move like an engineer, not just a student
