## **Overview**

JobIntel is a cloud-native project I built while studying for certifications and job hunting remotely. I wanted something more powerful than a spreadsheet or Notion board ‚Äî I wanted infrastructure, automation, and insights.

This project deploys a job application tracker with:
    - Full Terraform infrastructure
    - Slack integration for logging job events
    - CI/CD pipelines
    - OpenAI intelligence layer for analyzing feedback and rejection patterns
    - Resume version tracking + recruiter-facing S3 resume site

Every part of the project is mapped to a real certification and career-relevant DevOps skill.

## üìä Architecture Diagrams

This section provides versioned diagrams of the infrastructure and automation powering JobIntel.
Each diagram evolveed with the project, showcasing best practives, real-world patterns, and cloud-native growth over time.

### üõ† Infra Overview (Terraform to AWS S3)  

Terraform provisioning to AWS S3 using secure IAM access.

- **Terraform-Provisioned Infrastructure** ‚Äî declarative IaC to deploy a randomized, public-blocked S3 bucket via `random_id`, ownership control, and seecure authentication.

[![Infra Overview - Phase 1](docs/diagrams/infra-overview-v1.png)](docs/diagrams/infra-overview-v1.svg)

- **Phase 1 Scope** - Terraform CLI ‚Üí AWS Provider ‚Üí IAM Auth ‚Üí S3 Provisioning (no root user, secure bucket)

---

### üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)  

Pipeline enforcing Terraform quality standards and enabling automation.

- **CI/CD Pipeline via GitHub Actions** ‚Äî validates Terraform format, runs `terraform validate`, and auto-deploys Iac.

[![CI/CD Pipeline - Phase 2](docs/diagrams/ci-cd-pipeline-v1.png)](docs/diagrams/ci-cd-pipeline-v1.svg)

### üß† Phase 2: CI/CD Pipeline with Slack & Artifacts

Terraform CI/CD pipeline powered by GitHub Actions and Slack. Built for security, clarity, and real-world DevOps readiness.

### üöÄ Key Features

- Format, validate, and plan with each push
- JSON plan artifact creation
- Comment tfplan on PRs and pushes
- Slack notifications for success/failure
- Environment-based alert filtering (production only)
- Full workflow logs stored as artifacts

### üß© Diagrams

| Version | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| v1      | Basic CI pipeline: fmt, validate, plan |
| v2      | Advanced: tfplan output, Slack, logs, environment logic |

## **Why I Built This**

Because job hunting deserves DevOps, too.

I was studying, building, and applying all at the same time ‚Äî and this project let me do all three in one place. It‚Äôs my resume, my tracker, and my case study in infrastructure-as-career.
